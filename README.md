Starter Angular 5 application with server side rendering support on top of angular express engine. Built with `@angular/cli` with [added universal integration](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/wiki/stories-universal-rendering). Files are reorganized with minimum changes to have `src/client` and `src/server` structure.

## Installation

```
$ npm install
$ npm run build
OR 
$ npm run build:ngClient => this is for frontEnd rendering ?
```

## Starting Application

```
